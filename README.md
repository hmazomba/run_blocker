# run_blocker
run_blocker is a repository of experiments in Python. With this repo I plan on building my own personal assistant powered by an open-source large language model. I'm new to this space and would like to explore a dream I've had as a child: building my own intelligent robot. I hope this sparks something in me that will explore this dream with no fear. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any ideas.
