### Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The `headers` and `params` dictionaries are defined twice.
* The code is not very modular. The `get_submissions` function could be extracted into its own module.
* The code is not very secure. The `access_token` is hard-coded into the code. This could be a security risk if the code is ever compromised.

### Technical Debt

* The code is not very well tested. There are no unit tests or integration tests. This makes it difficult to catch bugs before they go into production.
* The code is not very well documented. There are no comments or docstrings explaining what the code does. This makes it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

### Security Issues

* The code is not very secure. The `access_token` is hard-coded into the code. This could be a security risk if the code is ever compromised.

### Maintainability

* The code is not very maintainable. The code is not very DRY, modular, or well-tested. This makes it difficult to make changes to the code without introducing bugs.

### Following Patterns

* The code does not follow any specific coding patterns. This makes it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

### Following Best Practices

* The code does not follow many of the best practices for writing Python code. For example, the code is not very DRY, modular, or well-tested.

### Potential Amount of Bugs

* The code has a high potential for bugs. The code is not very well tested, and there are no unit tests or integration tests. This makes it difficult to catch bugs before they go into production.

### Number of Code Duplicates

* The code has some code duplication. The `headers` and `params` dictionaries are defined twice.

### Efforts Spent on This Code

* It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. The code is not very well documented, so it is difficult to tell how much time was spent on each part of the code.

### Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

* I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well written, and it has a high potential for bugs. It would need to be rewritten to be more maintainable and secure.
